<h1>Climate</h1>

<h2>Temperature:</h2>
<p>Because the Mixedwood Plains is bounded by the Great Lakes, it has a modified temperature because it has both features of a continental and a maritime climate. The Mixedwood Plains has warm summers and cool winters but because of the nearby great lakes, there isn't too much temperature fluctuation. The average range in January when it gets the coldest is about -3&#8451; to 12&#8451;. In July when it gets the hottest, it gets to around 18&#8451; to 22&#8451;.</p>
<h2>Precipitation:</h2>
<p>The precipitation is also affected by the great lakes and therefore causes the Mixedwood Plains to have more precipitation then a normal continental climate but it doesn't get as much precipitation as a normal maritime climate would. The precipitation in the Mixedwood Plains yearly normally ranges from 720mm to up to 1000mm. Most maritime climates get a minimum of 1000mm and most continental climates never reach 1000mm.</p>

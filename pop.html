<h1>Population Density/ Distribution and Major Cities</h1>
<img src="human.JPG" width = "700" height = "450" alt="A picture of lots of people downtown to show the idea of human activites.">
<h2>Population Density/ Distibution:</h2>
<p>Half of Canada's Population lives in the Mixedwood Plains. It's the most popular ecozone in terms of population out of all of the ecozones. There are about 15,522 per km<sup>2</sup>. Now how this population is distributed is that the major cities have more of the population then the other areas of the ecozone.</p>
<h2>Major Cities:</h2>
<p>These cities that I am about to mention are known as the major cities because they have the larget populations compared to that of the other cities and also they really strive when it comes to their living standards, literacy rates, and life expectancies. In the Mixedwood Plains, some of these cities include, Kitchener,Ontario, Hamilton,Ontario, Quebec City,Quebec, Ottawa,Ontario, Montreal,Quebec, and Toronto,Quebec. These are some of the most populated cities in not just the Mixedwood Plains but in all of Canada.</p>

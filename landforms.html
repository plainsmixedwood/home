<h1>Landforms:</h1>
<img src="landforms.JPG" alt="A picture of some of the landoforms found in the Mixedwood Plains. The ones in the picture inlude forests and wetlands">
<p>Most of the landforms that were once found in the Mixedwood Plains were removed for urban development and agriculture as the Plains were situated upon arable land. The landforms that were there included waterfalls, rivers, plains, wetlands, and forests. Most of this ecozone is a nearly level or gently rolling plain as a result of most of this ecozone being under the Champlain Sea during the glacial times (9000 years ago). There are clay deposits where this sea once were.</p>

<h1>Soils</h1>

<p>The Mixedwood Plains has very productive and fertile soils. One of the many reasons why the forests were being cut down for centuries were because these soils were so good and people wanted to use the soil for agriculture purposes. Some of these soils included Luvisols, Brunisols, and Podzols. Podzols are usually located in the northern part of the Mixedwood Plains. While this soil is usually useless for agriculture, it's well suited for forestry and recreation. In the more southern part of the Mixedwood Plains, there are more Luvisol soils. These soils are usually more favoured when it comes to agriculture.</p>

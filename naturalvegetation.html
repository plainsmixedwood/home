<h2>Forests</h2>
<p>To start with vegetation, we'll start with the forests. At present, very little of the original forests remain because the forests have been cut down for centuries to be used for agriculture, logging, and urbanization.  Presently, the ecozone's forests consist of 12.8% mixedwood, 2.1% deciduous, and 0.2% coniferous trees. Some examples of these trees include the White Pine, Eastern Hemlock, Red Pine, Sugar Maple, Red Oak, and Basswood.  
<h2>Other Vegetation</h2>
<p>In these forests and even other landforms as well like the wetlands, there aren't just trees but also a number of different wildflowers and shrubs. Some of these include the Trilliums, the Clover, The Black-eyed Susans, cattails, water lilies, goldenrod, and number of other different plants.</p>

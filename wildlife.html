<p>There are a number of different types of animals and wildlife in the Mixedwood Plains. There are a number of different mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, molluscs, and even insects. These include the Canadian Geese, the Mallard Duck, the Whitetail Deer, the Red-tailed Fox, the Black Bear, the Groundhog, the Chipmunk, the grey and black Squirrel, the Blue jay, the red-headed woodpecker, the lake trout, the big mouthed bass, the zebra mussel, the boreal spittle bug, and I could go on and on forever. Many of these animals are attracted to the plains, the wetlands, the great lakes, the forests and other landforms that can be used as habitats.
